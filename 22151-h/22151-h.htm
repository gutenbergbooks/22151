<p><span class = "sidenote">
The secõd Diuision</span>
The second diuision shalbe of cohabitation or dwelling together / of
which one kinde ye free / that ys / where men be not compelled to
cõmunicate withe wicked superstitions / vngodly rites and

<p>An other kinde of cohabitation / or dwellinge together there is which
ys not free / and that ys where
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>

men are compelled to communicate withe wicked supersticions / to be
presente at Idolatries / and so to defyle them selues.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
The thred diuision.</span>
The thirde diuisiõ shalbe of the godlie and faithfull men them selues /
whiche are thus familiarlie conuersaunte withe the vnbeleuers. Either
they are learned stronge and able to confesse the doctrine of truithe in
religion / and to reproue and cõuince the false: orels they ar vnlearned
/ weake / and vnable to stande in the confession of the truithe / and
reprouinge of vntruthe.</p>

<p>These three diuisions shall suffice. Nowe will I put forthe certeyne
sentencis and propositions.<br>
The firste sentence and proposition / shalbe of those which in estate

of all wich I make this proposition.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
The furst proposition.</span>
Priuate men and subiectes / which ar learned and stronge / dwellinge in

wicked supersticions / they maye be famyliarlie conuersaunte / dwell ãd
liue together with the vnbeleuers This maye they do / but yet vnder
certeyn cõditiõs / and obseruinge certeyn rules.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
1</span>
<span class = "sidenote">
Rules to bekept.</span>
Of which the firste ys this / that they do teache thos vnbeleuers with
whom they do liue and are familiarlie conuersaunte / and do instructe
them in the truithe / trulye teachinge them and earnestlie callinge them
/ vnto the knowledge of the truithe /

and faythe in Christe. And this they muste not leaue of to do so longe
as they be dwellinge and familiar with them. To the end also that they
maye do this the better / yt ys not vnlawfull / but moste conuenient for
them to shewe them selues frendlie / gẽtill / and louinge <ins class =
"notation" title = "text unchanged">unto</ins> the vnbeleauers withe whõ
they are familiarlie conuersaunte / and dwellinge / So that theise maye
perceyue that the faythfull do loue thẽ: els ys yt to be feared that
they shall do no good withe them. for that doctrine ys moste redylie
receyued of the hearer / which cõmeth from him / of whom the hearer ys
persuaded / that he ys hys frende / and that he louithe hym indeede.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
2</span>
The second thinge that the faythfull must take heede of / ãd Rule which
they must obserue ys this: That they do lyue an holy lyfe / and that
amonge the vnbeleauers their conuersacion be so godly / graue / comely /
and agreing with their profession / that in no wise they do gyue any
offence through the wickednes of their lyfe: for yf by their lyfe the
vnfaythfull shuld be offendid / then shuld their mynistery be
vnprofitable to the vnbeleuers / for that by their euell doings they
shuld ouerthrowe what soeuer they labored to builde vpp in wordes.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
3</span>
The thred thinge that theise men must take heede of / and Rule which
they must obserue is. That they do not communicate / with the
vnfaythfull in their supersticiõs and idolatries / nor iet do so mutch
as outwardly to seame to allowe them. Thys ys not to be doone in ony
wise / no not in hope therby
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 008 -->
to wynne the vnbeleauer from hys supersticion / and Idolatrie:
<span class = "sidenote">
Ro. 3</span>
For this Rule of the holy ghoste doth euer remain certain / Euell things
ar not to be doone / that goode maye comme therof. This vnchaungeable
rule must not be broken.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
4</span>
The fourth and last thing that theise men must take heede of / and Rule
which they must <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘obserũe’">obserue</ins> is this. That they haue not ther familiar
conuersaciõ with the vnbeleuers for their own cause / as for their
pleasure and recreacion / or for their gayn and profite / but only in
respect of wynnynge them to the gospell of christe. Neither ys this
conuersacion and companie / contynually to be hadd and kept with the
vngodly and vnbeleuers / but so long as ther is goode hoope of wynninge
/ and conuerting thẽ to <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘thẽ’">the</ins> gospell of christe. For yf the vnbeleauers shall shew
themselues so obstinate in their euell / that they giue iuste cause to
despaire of ther amendement / then ar they vtterly to be forsaken / and
no conuersacion or cõpanie is to be hadd with them / farther thẽ the
necessitie of lyfe enforcith either partie. As yff the vnbeleauers shuld
be in such extreme necessitie / that they could not be releaued but at
the hand of the faythfull: or yf theise shuld be in that necessitie /
that they could not otherwise obtain thinges necessarie but of the
vnfaithfull. Also in byinge and selling thinges necessarie for the lyfe
/ as garmentes / victuals / and such like: Agayn in such thinges as
cyuile estates / and condicions do require / as of princes and Rulars to
demaunde

lawfull defence / and to obey them in thinges <ins class = "notation"
title = "text unchanged">lawfvll</ins>: to fathers / maried folke /
masters / ãd such lyke / to do thos duties which ar appointed in godds
worde. In theise thinges to vse the vnbeleauers / or to minister vnto
them / ys not vnlawfull.</p>

<p>Thus and in thys manier / yt ys lawfull for a priuate mã / which is
lerned / ãd constãt in godds truithe / being in that place wher no man
ys compelled to be partaker of wicked supersticions / to dwell together
/ and vse familiar conuersacion with the vnbeleuers and vnfaythfull / as
theise named Rules and condicions / do appoint and suffer. And so haue
ye this proposiciõ declared and opened / The same ys cõfirmed / by the
example of Christ our Sauiour. He dyd resorte to the dyners / and
feastes / where scribes and pharisees / publicanes and synners were / to
thys ende onlie / euen to teache them and to winne them vnto the
Gospell. So saieth hierom.
<span class = "sidenote">
Hiero in Matt. cap. 9.</span>
The lorde dyd go vnto the feastes of synners / that he mighte haue
occasion to teache them and that he mighte gyue spirituall meates to
them which dyd bydde hym: and after speaking how christe went ofte to
feastes / Theare ys (saithe he) no other thinge reported / but what he
dyd / and what he taughte there. That bothe the humblenes of the lorde
in goinge to synners / and the power of hys doctrine in conuertinge the
penitents / mighte be declared.</p>

<p>After the same maner / the prophetes in the olde tyme were
conuersaunte with the Idolatrous people.
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 010 -->
So were the Apostles famyliarlie conuersaunte with the vnbeleuinge Iues
/ and went also emõgest other vnbeleuing nations and men.
<span class = "sidenote">
Act. 17.</span>
S.&nbsp;Paule when he came to Athens / dyd not thinke skorne so
famyliarlie to behaue him selfe that he went in to the temples of their
Idolls / and verye curiouslie searched the corners of the same / he dyd
viewe their altars / the titles and inscriptions of ther altars / so
that he founde owte that title /
<em>Ignoto Deo</em> which was an altar dedicated vnto the vnknowen God /
wherof he dyd take occacion to make that same hys sermon in which he
preached Christe vnto them euen as yt were owt of their own bokes.</p>

<p>And thus / I&nbsp;thinke / that this our proposition / (which of yt
owne selfe ys plaine and euident ynoughe) ys sufficientlie proued.
Namelie thys / that a priuate man / learned / and constaunte in the
truithe / beinge in that place where no man ys compelled to communicate
with wicked supersticions / maye be familiarlie conuersante with the
vnbeleuers / so longe as in hys conuersation he doth obserue and kepe /
the conditions before mencioned.
<span class = "sidenote">
Cõuersation <ins class = "notation" title = "text unchanged">vuith</ins>
men excõmunicate.</span>
Here I thinke good to adde / as yt were by the waye of admonicion / that
kepinge these rules and conditions / yt ys lawfull for the godlie to be
conuersaunte with them which be excommunicate / euen to call them in to
the waye of godlynes / and not to communicate with them in any euill or
synne.
<span class = "sidenote">
The secũd proposition.</span>
Nowe will I put forthe an other proposition or sentence / whiche shalbe
of those persons whych
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<!-- png 011 -->
be of a priuate estate and are subiectes / of that cohabitacion which ys
fre wher no man is compelled to communicate with wicked supersticions /
ãd of suche men as be vnlearned in the knowledge of gods truithe / weake
in faythe / and therfor vnable to make a christian confession of
truithe. Thys collection agreeth with that which I gathered before / of
which I made my former proposition / sauinge that wheras there / with
the priuate estate and free dwellinge /
<span class = "sidenote">
Ignoraũnce in men is intollerable.</span>
I&nbsp;coupled men that were learned and stronge to confesse the truithe
/ heare I do adde in the place of them / men vnlearned / vnable / and to
weake to confesse the truithe. But herin thincke not that I do alowe
suche ignoraunce and vnablenes in men. Suche ignoraunce in men is
sharply to be reproued / for ther is none so veri an idiote / so simple
and vnlearned amonge Christianes / but he ys bounde in conscience to be
able to rendre an accompte of hys faythe / ãd also to be somwhat able to
teache and instructe others / yea and to saye somwhat for the truthe /
in all the principall poyntes of the christian faythe / which he may do
yf he be but meanlie instructed in the Catechisme. But bicause / partlie
throughe the peruersnes of the ministers which do not their office to
instructe men / partlie throughe the negligence of men which do not
their dutie in seekinge to be instructed / suche ignoraunce there is /
I&nbsp;admytt therfore into this my collection those ignoraunte / vnable
/ and weake men. And so I make this proposition. Those men
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 012 -->
which are of a priuate estate and condition / dwellinge or beinge in a
place where they be not compelled to communicate with wicked
supersticions. And are them selues vnlearned and vnable to confesse and
defende the truithe / maye not vse famyliar conuersation with the
vnbeleuers.</p>

<p>These men ar not in that condition that the learned be / of whom I
dyd speake before / for they cannot teache the vnbeleuers / yea they be
not able to defende the gospell of christe from the blasphemie of the
vnbeleuers / neither can they deliuer them selues frõ suche false snares
as the vnbeleauers shall laye for thẽ: Wherfor they must not haue
familiar conuersaciõ with them / through which they shall thus throwe
themselues into perill / and ieoperdie: Except that they can assure
themselues of such strẽghth / that they shall not yealde vnto the
wickednes of the vnbeleuers. Otherwise / if they shall happen to dwell
togither in one place with the vnfaithfull: Lett thẽ take goode heede
that they do lyue an holy lyfe amonge them: And for the rest / let them
so far as the necessitie of lyfe / and ciuile businesses and affaires
shall suffer them / vtterly abstayn from the companie of the
vnbeleauers.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;question.</span>
But heere risith a question: Whether that such a weake and vnlearned man
/ maye learn ony of the liberall artes / or philosophie / of such a
master as is an vnbeleauer.</p>

<p>Vnto which I answer: that forbicause to lern such artes of an
vnfaithfull master is not of such
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<!-- png 013 -->
necessitie as can not be auoided / therfor the man that ys weake in
faithe must not lern them of hym. Yt is a very daungerus thinge / to vse
them which ar vnbeleauers as Masters and teachers: for often tymes in
the myndes of the hearers ther arisith a gret admiracion and estimaciõ
of the teacher / and it maye easilye com to pas at the lẽghthe / that
they shall thincke and Iudge that theise teachers ar not deceyued in
Religion / bicause they be of an exacte and perfect knowledge in these
liberall sciences / ãd philosophie. This (I&nbsp;saye) may happẽ of it
that men ar wont to attribute mutch vnto their teachers. Yea that it may
be so / I&nbsp;will proue by the cõtrarie. Origen by teaching the
Mathematicalls / and such sciences / did bring many mẽ to the knowledge
of christe. For furst he dyd begyn to reade among them such sciences
with which they wer delighted / In which he being expert / dyd shew vnto
his hearers suche connynge / that he dyd forthewith gett amonge them
great estimacion / and so the more easili drawe them vnto the doctrine
of christe. Augustine likewise cam to Millaine / to heere Ambrose /
bicause he was counted an excellent Rhetorician. And so whilst he
desirusly herd hym / at the lenghth by hearinge he was tourned form the
sect of the Manichees / vnto the true catholiques. As therfor by lerning
of these sciences of godly teachers / the vnbeleauers haue beene
conuerted vnto the faithe of christe / euen so / yea mutch more easilie
it maye comme to pas / that they which
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 014 -->
ar weake and vnlearned / may vnder vnbeleauinge masters / be drawn from
christe to vngodlynes.<br>
Wherefor seing that this can not be doone without great perill and

He doth not grant vnto euery mans will thys libertie / and fredom / but

wold go thether to drincke droncken / glotonusly to fill the belly / or

<p>The histories of the heathen do teache vs the same thinge. Alexander

be by all meanes ernestly sought / both in the reprouing of their

that they wer gods peculiar people / and that they shulde separate
themselues from the gentils / that they shuld not be conuersaunt with
them / neither shuld they ioyne themselues in familiaritie withe them /
farther then the necessitie of either of the lyues did require. The
Iuishe gardes we do reiect / but this which is ment by the gardes we
both do and must retayne. In many places the lorde commaunded the Iues
also that they shuld not return into Egypte / and that they shuld not
aske healpe of the Egiptians / nor of the Assirians: Which he did partly
to this end / that through such familiaritie as then must haue beene

Do we (saithe Paule to the corinthians) prouoke the lorde? Ar we strõger

becõme stronger than he.</p>

<p>Many more reasons might I bringe to proue this proposicion true. That
a priuate man / being in a place wher he is not compelled to communicate
with the supersticiõs of the vnfaithfull / and is vnlearned vnable / and
to weake to confesse the truithe / must not ioyne in familiaritie / nor
be familiarly dwelling and conuersant together with the vnfaithfull. But
bicause I do suppose that it is sufficiently proued by the reasons which
I haue alledged / I&nbsp;will now prepare myself to an other
proposicion.</p>

<p>The thred proposicion shalbe / of Priuate men and subiectes / which
ar lerned and stronge / and of them also which ar weake and vnlearned /
of that dwelling which is not fre / wher as men ar compelled by lawes /
and Tyrannye to communicate and to be partakers with the wicked in their
supersticions and Idolatries: And of theise I make this proposicion /

in this case a faithfull man must either flye / or dye for the truithe /

S.&nbsp;Paul saith to the Corinthians: flye ye Idolatrie. Then do men
flye Idolatrie / when either they do depart frõ the place wher Idolatrie
is cõmitted / or when abiding still in the same place / they do gyue
their lyues and suffer deathe bicause they will not cõmitt Idolatrie nor
allowe it with ther presence. Paul therfor teachith by this sayinge /
that in no wise the faithfull shuld come at the Idolatries of the
vnfaithfull / but flye frõ them: which sentence is so playn to the
vnderstondinge of the most symple / that it neadith no exposicion at

considre and wel vnderstande / that theris no owtwarde worcke wiche is

God can not be truly worshipped with out faithe, for if faithe be not in

And to proue that the masse with all such popishe baggadge is verye

dothe easelie teache it. There is no true god that wilbe worshipped with
this popishe seruice: for the true liuinge god hathe in his worde

not worshippe that true lyuinge godd / whõ the holy scripture teachith

their seruices: But seinge that in verye dede there is no suche true god

teache vs that the moste vile and horrible whordome is Idolatrie.
Hieremie / Ezechiel / ãd the other prophettes do speake so against the

But paule telleth them plainlye that they do communicate with deuills.
The meates offered to Idolls of their owne nature were pure / yet when
the corinthians do eate them with the Idolatrors in ther Idolatrie /
then they become (saith paule) partakers of the table of deuilles: when
ye then be present at a Masse / which is an Impure thinge / and do ther
as the papistes do / mutch more iustly is it sayed of you / that then ye
ar partakers of thos deulishe <ins class = "notation" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘drugges’?">dragges</ins> which ar in the Masse.
Again our men do obiecte and saye: It is not we that haue corrupted
theis thinges / we wolde be gladde to haue them pure and incorrupte:
ther impuritie must not be adscribed vnto vs. I&nbsp;answer: An other
mans synne shall not indeede be imputed vnto the / for eche man shall
beare his owne synne: but yet this thinge I do reproue in the / that
thou dost communicate with wickednes: This is thy synne / here thou art
defyled. and for this shalt thou be iudged. Paule sayde vnto the
corinthians:
<span class = "sidenote">

Ar not they which do eate of the sacrifice / partakers of the temple?
what saye I then? that the Image is any thinge? or that it which is

which the gentills do offer / they offer to deuels
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 048 -->
and not to god. I&nbsp;wolde not that ye sholde haue fellowshippe with
the deuills: ye can not drincke of the cuppe of the lorde / and of the
cuppe of Deuels / ye can not be partakers of the table of the lorde and
of the table of deuels. Thoughe corrupcion of meates offred vnto Idols
is not to be imputed to all them that be partakres of them / (which wer
not indeede corrupt of thẽ selues (as I saide), but when they wer offred
vnto Idols that made them corrupte) yeat the veraye communicating and
eating of them with Idolatrors is a fault iustly layed to their charge /
from which they shuld haue keapte themselues aswell for the honor that
they do owe vnto godd / as for the conscience which they ought to haue
to edyfie other men. If it wer not so / whi did paule thus rebuke the
Corinthians? Yea whi wolde not our holy martirs of the primitiue churche
communicat and be partakers in the Sacrifices of the heathẽ? The martirs
might haue saide / we knowe that an Idoll is nothing / and to offer vp
sence to them is but an owtward thing / we do it but in bodie / our
spret and harte is pure / and that we do / against our will we do it
&amp;c. They veryly did know no suche excuse / but they cõsidered that
godd required this / that they shuld outwardly confes hym / and reproue
/ and fle from Idolatrie: And therfor aswell for their duties sake
towarde godd / as bicause they wold not offend the brethern by their

These men do saye further that the Masse is not to be lickened iustly
vnto the Idolatrie of the heathen / for that was directly forbidden of
godd / so is not the Masse / saye they: for thoughe it hathe sumwhat
swarued aside / yeat is it the Instituciõ of christe. But to the
contrarie I do saye / that the Masse is so farr swarued from the
ordinaunce of christe / that it hathe nothing agreing with christis
Institucion / yea and that it is most directly repugnãt ũto it /
A&nbsp;very Idoll / wherin massemũgers do committe very vile Idolatrie.
And this will I proue by diuers reasons. ffurst of all. The Supper of
the Lorde / as it was delyuered of christe shold be a publique and a
common worcke and action: for Christe our Sauiour made it with his
Apostles. But nowe in the Masse / ther commithe forthe one sacrificing
preste / disguised with straunge araye / and he doth all thinges alone /
the rest stonde still loking / heeringe / and holding their peace. If
paule did worthely and Iustly saye / when the Corinthians did not tarie
and loke one for an other / that they did not then eate the Lordes
supper / then ther is not the Lordes supper eaten / wher one tarieth not
for an other so that they maye eate all together: And how shall we then
saye / that the Masse is the Lordes supper / wher one only sacryficing
prest doth eate and drincke vpp all alone? surly it can not be so
called: for to be, and not to be the Lords supper / ar
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 050 -->
contrarie / Paule saith / it is not the Lords supper / wherfor call your
Masse by what name ye will / the Lords supper it is not / for paule is
to be beleaued before all massinge marchauntes.<br>
They saye morouer that in their Masse / they do offer vpp the sonne of
godd vnto the eternall father for the synnes of the quicke and the
deade: And this they do call the principall point of their masse. But in
the Laste Supper of the Lorde that Scacrifice and oblaciõ was not made /
but vppõ the crosse / as the scripture witnessith. And as for this their
offerẽge / ffurst / paul doth denie it in most playn words in the
epistle to the hebrues /<span class = "sidenote">
Heb. 9. 10.</span>
wher he sayeth that all oblacions for synne wer consummate and finished
/ and all thinges made perfect by that one only oblacion / which christe
Iesus our Sauiour in his own parson made of hymself vppon the crosse.
The worde of godd teachithe / that christe was but ons only to be
sacrificed and offered / And that Sacrifice no more to be made: for if
it wer often to be made / then the furst was not perfect / But the furst
was perfect / Therfor ther must be no repeating of it. The papistes do
saye / that they dayly offer christe for to take awaye synne / and that
this Sacrifice must be dayly repeted of them /
The scripture denieth this playnly: And thus ye do se that heere is a
playne contradiction.</p>

<p>Again The supper of the Lorde was not instituted
<span class = "pagenum">
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘27’">26</ins></span>
<span class = "folionum">Dij</span>
<!-- png 051 -->
to the end that such a sacrifice for synne (as they fayne) shuld be made
of it / but that in the vse of it the communicantes shuld be put in
mynde / and made partakers of that only propiciatorie sacrifice which
christe offered ons only for all euer vppon the crosse. And therfor ther
Masse / in which they wold worcke such marueyles / and the Lordes supper
ar vtterly vnlyke. But here they will reply and saye.</p>

<p>The fathers do speake thus of this Sacrifice / We graunte indeede /
that the fathers do often tymes speake so as thoughe that the lorde wer
offered in this administracion of the Sacrament / or sacrificed: But
they vsed this worde / Sacrifice, improperly / for by that kinde of
speaking they did onderstonde / the offringes of praise / and sacrifices
of thanckes made and gyuen for christes sacrifice done vppon the crosse
/ This they called to sacrifice. Our sacrificing prests ar not content
with this / for they will haue their own worcke to be an vnwonted worcke
/ belonging to them alone / which neither the scriptures / nor the
fathers do teache: ffor to offer this Sacrifice of whiche the fathers do
speake / partayneth not to the preist alone / but to the whole poeple
that stõdith by / and doth cõmunicate / And so it is a
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 052 -->
common oblacion and sacrifice of all / not of the preiste more then of
the poeple / but this only that the preist both in wordes and action /
doth go before the poeple.<br>
<span class = "sidenote">
de Ciuitate dei. lib. 10. cap. 6.</span>
Augustine doth saye / that the churche is offered in that offeringe
which it doth offer. For all which do communicate / they do offer them
selues vnto godd / and do testifie that their will is / to abide in
christe.<br>
The papistes do holde also that the breade is turned into the substaunce
of christes bodie / and that ther remaynith nothing but the qualitie and
accidẽce of breade as whitenes / &amp;c. for the substaũce / saye they /
is christes bodie. But the scripture saith that christe in his laste
supper did gyue breade vnto his disciples /
<span class = "sidenote">
1. Cor. 11.</span>
and paule callith it breade also / yeat in the Masse the papistes saye
that it is otherwise.<br>
The vse of the breade and wyne by christis instituciõ is only / that the
congregacion shuld eate and drincke therof in the remembrance of christe
/ But the papistes in their Masse do most shamefully abuse them both.
For wheare as the worde of godd saythe:

rowme of godd they sett them furthe to be adored and worshipped of the
poeple: now how farr this differrith from the vse of christes supper
eich man may se. Yea what can be more vile and filthie Idolatrie / then
to adore and worshipp a peace of brede ãd cupp of wyne / as godd? Be not

vse theise bare names. I&nbsp;do confes / that whosoeuer acording to the
Lordes Instituciõ doth cõmunicate with the cõgregaciõ and dothe eate the
breade ãd drinke of the cupp of the Lorde / beholding the deathe of
christe with Lyuely faithe / the same man is in sprete ãd after his
manier / made partaker of the body ãd bludd of the lorde. Contrari wise
if thow do not vse the breade and wyne acordinge to the ordinaunce of
christe / but gase vppon them / then ar they nothinge els to the / but
breade ãd wyne: But if in a popishe Masse / or in the popishe hãging /
heauing / carying / or handelinge of them / thow do worshipp them / thẽ
ar they vnto the a false Idoll / ãd thow indeede a filthie Idolatror. If
therfor thow wilt be partaker of the body and bludd of christe in the
holy supper / then eate the breade and drincke the cupp as the lorde
hathe instituted. Godd wold haue the poeple in the vse of the holy
Supper to ascend vppwarde into heauen in mynde and affectiõ / that they
might ther cleaue fast vnto christe. And therfor the true ministers of
the churche do labour to the vttermost of their poure / thus to lifte
vpp the poeples mynde into heauen / that they shuld not seeke christe in
the worlde / that they shuld not thinck ony fleshly or earthely thinge
of hym: Theise men clean contrarie in the order of their Sacrament and
Masse do miserably detayn the poeple in the earthe / bynding and holding
them to the visible signes.</p>

<p>Those wordes of our greate and singuler consolation / in wich the
partakinge of Christes bodye and bloude is promised / the papistes in

knowe the Latine tonge cã neither heare thẽ nor vnderstande them. And so

these words in secrete / bicause they wolde not haue their Lies knowen /
for they do saye / Take ye and

who taketh / or to whõ do they giue? The wordes be spokẽ to the people:
And yet they thẽ selues do eate and drike vp all alone / and do

takẽ to be an euill thĩge / but before god to lie / is a moste shamles
and wiked thinge: who dothe eate (o&nbsp;ye lyyng papistes) or who doth
drinke wyth you? If ye do distribute at any tyme to ony other ye do yt
not when ye your selues receyue / but ye chose for them an other time /
yea and another kinde also / for to thẽ ye do minister but the breade
onlye. Thus ye se that all theise thinges which these massers do in
their masse / ar contrarye to the institution of Christe. Ther masse
then and Christes supper ar not lyke.</p>

<p>The papistes saye that by their Action (I&nbsp;meane ther handeling
of ther breade and wyne) they do applie vnto others the profitt of
Christs bloudie sacrifice and passiõ. Of a Sacramẽt they saye that they
make sacrifices to profit the quicke and the Deade. and this do they ĩ
ther masse. But the scripture teacheth / that there is but one only
propiciatorie sacrifice / able and auaylable to take awaie synnes /
whiche Christe Iesus offered in his owne fleshe vpon the Crosse. And
that euerie man muste applie vnto him selfe by liuelie faythe the
benefite of that same sacrifice of christe / as the scripture teacheth
likewise / that eche man is iustified by his own faithe, and
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 056 -->
that eche man in his owne righteousnes or vnrighteousnes / doth liue /
or die. It teachithe also that christe did institute the sacrament only
to this end that the congregacion shuld eate and drincke it in the
remẽberaunce of that same his Sacrifice. And that eiche one in the
drincking therof shuld apply vnto himself by faithe / the fruite of that
Sacrifice. Now compare the doctrine of the scriptures and of the
papistes in this pointe together / and thou shalt se that their Masse is
contrarie to christes Institucion. But as they haue / so still will they
saye:</p>

<p>That aswell the liuing as the deade be helped by this their acte
applied at their pleasure. If they wolde saie that thei profyt others by
praier / that were tollerable. But they go further and saie / that ther
verye massinge worcke it selfe / hathe so moche vertue / power ãd
strenghthe in it / that it shall profit not only all kyndes of mẽ / but
all such creatures ãd beastes for whom they do say ther masse / bicause
in it they do applye the benefite of christes passion: but ye must
vnderstõd whẽ they be payed for ther labor. This is an horrible error in
no wise to be suffered / for as I sayed / ther is but one only sacrifice
propiciatorie to take awaye synne / which one sacrifice eiche one of vs
must applie vnto our selues by liuelie faythe / And this applyinge
faithe is the only gifte of god: But on this grounde buylde they their
purgatorie and mutch other such pelf / by which they do pycke mens

in the honor of this / or of that saincte. And of what saintes? suche
verylie whose histories are not certaynlie knowen / and are of none
authoritie / yea many of thẽ are no better then poetes fables / of whõ
not vnworthelie we doubte whether they be sainctes or no: But be it that
they were true sainctes / yet this their doinge is moste cõtrarie to
christes ordinance / for Christe did institute his supper to this ende
that it sholde be vsed in the remembrance of his deathe and not of other
mens / weare they neuer so holye.</p>

<p>In their masse they haue also diuers and sundrie rytes ãd customs /
clothes / signes / gestures / tornes / remouinges / ãd blissinges / of
and with the breade ãd wine / but christe vsed none of all theis in his
supper: And what they do meane by these thinges the poeple doth not
knowe / neither can the priestes them selues for the most part tell what
is ment by them: for if ye aske the meaninge of them / either cã they
saye nothinge at all / or if they do saie owghte / they do not saye all
one thinge / but thinges that be moste cõtrarie / wherby a mã maie iudge
that there is no truithe at all in their wordes. But here they do saie.
Thinkest thou that the foolishe vnlearned people in the olde Lawe dyd
vnderstand all the legall ceremonies? no it was not requisite / no more
is yt nowe: To this I answer / Althoughe that all the poeple dyd not
knowe what was mente by them in the olde lawe / It sufficed yet that
they hade the worde of god for them / Nowe do yee shewe vnto vs the
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>

worde of god for theise your signes and it shall suffice <a class =
"error" name = "error29v" id = "error29v" href = "#corr29v">vs.</a><br>
Agayne the godly and lerned preistes could shew what was ment by the
rites and ceremonies of the lawe / and that by the word of godd: but ye
can do neyther of theis: for ye haue enuented theis toyes in your own
braynes: signes ye do call them but ye do not know what thinges they do
signifie. And therfor as in rites your Masse doth differ from christes
supper / so whẽ ye saye your pleasure of your rites / ye ar not to be
beleaued: for faith hath no place where goddes worde doth not shew it
selfe. I&nbsp;saide that massemungers in their masse do committ
Idolatrie. Their bready god hanged vp in a pix / and their Images / vnto
which they turne them selues and do make their moste vncleane seruice
and sacrifice do proue this true: Neither do they accompte it sufficient
to behold theis their Idols when they saye their Masses / but also they
so offer vnto them / they cense them / they bowe the knee vnto them: let
them nowe denye whilest they will that they do not worship the breade /
nor the Images / yet this worship they do them / This kinde of worship
(I&nbsp;saye) which is giuen customabilie vnto god alone / as the lawe
of god teacheth. But seing they giue this vnto these Idols / are they
not Idolatrors? yes truly. And howe thẽ dare ony christian be present
there / to vncouer the heade to bowe the kne to offer and do such like
thinges with them?</p>

<p>They saye that ther Masse is christes Institution / And our men (of
whom I now haue spoken) do saye that the Masse hath sum affinitie with
christes institucion of the holy supper.</p>

<p>But I saye that the olde heathens myghte wyth more coloure of truithe
/ excuse and defende their sacrifices by that maner / then these men
maye do their masse. ffor verylye the sacrifices of the heathen haue
lesse departed from the maner which the fathers vsed in sacrificinge
before the lawe giuẽ / which also the lorde approued in the lawe / thẽ
these massers do frome the supper which Christe / and the Apostle paule
hathe prescribed. In bothe their sacrifices was the inuocation of god /
a&nbsp;Temple / an Aultar / slayne sacrifices / sacrificinge priestes /
sleynge of beastes / sheddinge of bloude / salte / wine / oyle / mele /
an holy feaste / holy garmentes / washinge / censinge / fyer / singinge
/ prophecies / and suche other thinges / all which to repeate it were to
longe: let our Massers (if they can) shewe so many thinges which Christe
did in the holye supper: Which thinge if they can not do / then let them
cease to boaste that their Masse is the institution of Christ and the
Apostles / from which it differethe so farre that if the Apostles and
fathers of the primatyue churche were nowe here to beholde this

masse / they sholde not knowe it to be the lords supper / but wolde
surlie marueyle at suche a monstruous mahometrie.<br>
I&nbsp;omytte also that in and with their Masse they haue many
Anniuersaries yearemyndes / diriges done for the deade: But The Lord did
not institute ony of them. If they saye that Cyprian and others of the
fathers do speake of suche Annyuersaries: I&nbsp;answer that those of
which the fathers do make mencyon / were nothinge els but thãckfull
remẽbraũces of the Martirs departed / in which they did gyue thancks to
godd for thẽ. They also in their Masses do call vppon the saintes and
holy men departed / which is a thing most contrarie to true godlynes /
and vtterly vnknown and vnpracticed in the administracion of the Lordes
supper.<br>
And to be shorte all their thinges which they do in their Masses / they
do choppe and chaũge / they bye and sell and sett them furthe to most
vile and filthie gayne. Wherfor / my most Louing Brethern take ye
diligent heede / les whilest ye pretend to worshipp godd in your going
to Masses / and to entreate hym to be mercifull vnto yow / ye do not
most mightyly kindle his wrathe against you by hearinge of theise
Masses: which as ye playnly do se / ar nothing els but a shamfull deuise
sett vpp to deface the deathe of christe / a&nbsp;pestilent practise
fownde out to ouerthrowe the true vse of the Lordes supper / and an
Idolatrie inuented to infect the poeple and to make them Idolatrors.

was not yet prepared and readye to denye and forsake hymself and all
that was his for goddes sake. He thought that it might cõme to pas that
he shuld together with the knowledge of the Lyuing godd / easili holde
and keape still his old place / office / and dignitie / if he coulde
happen to haue that / which he desired of the prophet: And when he did
well perceyue that this was his infirmitie and synne / it trobled himso
that therfor he desired the prayers and helpe of Heliseus: he desired
hym / that if he shuld happen to fall into this euill / yeat that he
might be fauored / that he mighte finde mercie / ãd that Heliseus wold
praye that the Lorde wolde forgyue hym. Who doth at ony tyme aske
forgyuenes for that which he accõptithe Lawfull? forgyuenes is asked for
synnes only / Naaman therfor acknowledged this his acte to be a synne:
And if I so fall (quod he) then praye the Lorde to forgyue me. This
place therfor doth make most against our men / and euen the same wayes
which they go about to excuse their facte / by the same it is most
playnly proued to be synne. Let them aknowledge therfor in their doĩge
that thinge / which Naaman the Sirian did. And let them begg the mercie
of godd / and the prayers of godly men / that the

same thing which they haue euell doone / and do / maye be pardoned them.
Neither did Eliseus / as our men do thincke / graunte Naaman licence or
libertie to do so as he hadd sayde / but only he saide vnto hym / goo in
peace: which manier of speaking was a kind of takinge leaue vsed in that
age. And as for any other thinge ther can none be gathered out of thos
wordes / onles it be this that he promised to do that which Naaman
required: goo thy wayes (saithe he) I&nbsp;will do as thow desirest /
I&nbsp;shall praye for the. The prophet doth not reiect hym / if he
shuld fall into this euell. As we do not vtterly reiect nor shutt theise
mẽ frõ grace which thus do fall: Yeat must we sharply reproue their
doinges that they may acknowledge their fault and synne / and vnfaynedly
lament and repẽt the same. And we ought also hartily to praye that they
may be raysed vpp agayn. They do obiect also certayn wordes out of the
Epistle of Ieremie / which is ẽtitled Baruch. The wordes ar theise.

Now shall ye see in Babilon godds of golde / of syluer / of wodde / and

not the feare of thẽ ouercome yowe. Therfor when ye do see the multitude
of poeple worshipping them behinde and before / saye yee in your hartes
/ O&nbsp;Lord / it is thow that oughtest only to be worshipped / Of
theise wordes our men do gather / that it is sufficient for them when

Masses / and popishe supersticions / to saye in ther harte / O&nbsp;Lord
it is thow that oughtest only to be worshipped. In answer to these men:
furst I saye / that this booke entitle Baruch is none of the Canonicall
scriptures: And therfor no man is bownd to the doctrine of it. But admit
the booke wer of sufficient auctoritie / Then theise men must
vnderstonde / that the prophet doth not gyue the Iues leaue to comme
vnto the temples of Idols / that ther they might be present at vngodly
Idolatrie / bowe ther knee / and so make vpp the matier / with sayinge
in their hart to the true and lyuyng godd / O&nbsp;Lord / it is thow
that oughtest only to be worshipped. But he gyuith the Iues instruction
against Images which wer caried about / ãd Idolatries which wer vsed in
those places wher they were exiles: ffor the Maneir of the Babilonians
was / not only to haue Images in ther temples / but also to haue them
sett abroode and caried openly vppon mens shulders. As it is not vnlike
that the Image of Nabugodonosor, which beinge dedicated in the feilde of
dura, was caried aboute the whole Regiõ with Musicall Instrumẽtes ãd
sõges / at the sownde of which whersoeuer the Image was seene /
commaundemẽt was gyuẽ vnto all mẽ that they shuld worshipp it: which
Daniels felows wolde not do. Of theise thinges I saye / that epistle
entreatithe / playnlye to warne the godly / that they shuld not adore /
nor worshipp thos Idols thoughe that the heathenishe poeple did so bothe
before

them / and behind them / but when they did see this Idolatrie /
detesting it / they shuld then saye / O&nbsp;lord / it is thou to whome
worshipp doth only belõge: he saied not / bowe the knee with thẽ / and
saye in your hartes / o&nbsp;lord / it is thou &amp;c. but when ye do
see these Idols and Idolatrye / say so. These seyngs and suddayn
meetings in the cytie streetes ãd fieldes / could not be auoyded / and
therfor the godly were to be enstructed and admonished / how they shuld
behaue them selues in that case.</p>

<p>But our men / as they are veraye bolde to abuse the scripture for
their purpose / go on further and aske / how it happened that Daniel was
not throwen into the fierie fornace with his felowes?
<span class = "sidenote">
Daniel. 3.</span>
seing lyke punishement was appointed vnto all men which did not
worshippe. They will of necessitie haue it graunted them therfor / that
Daniel did dissemble / (as they now do) and that therfor nothing was
done vnto hym: And that thinge which Daniel dyd / they thincke that they
maye do. I&nbsp;aunswer our men thus / that they do not reason well to
saye / He was not punished / therfor he was ther and worshipped / they
do out more in the consequẽt / then is in the antecedẽt / and so to
reason is to make a subtill cauillacion / taking that to be a cause
which is no cause. For there might be many other causes / wherfor Daniel
was not likewise punished: happilie the Image ãd he did not meete
together: or yf he did meete it / men did not mark what he did: or els
though men marcked that he did not worshipp / yet he was not accused:
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 066 -->
or yf he were accused / yet through the singular fauour which the King
did beare vnto him he was delyuered from punishmẽt. It must not then
forthewith folowe / that Daniel for feare of death did present himself
before that Idoll / and did dissemble his Religion / doing there as
other Idolatrors did: this we must not iudge of Daniel /
<span class = "sidenote">
Daniel. 6.</span>
seing in the lyke quarell / he was not afrayde to be thrown vnto the
lyõs. Now seing there may be many other causes why he was not caste into
the fire with his felowes / why do these men chose vnto them selues this
one cause? and that such a one / as is sclaũderous vnto that holy man /
of which in the holy scriptures / there is not so much as a suspicion
contayned. Yet they do thinke that they do not vnaptly saye for
themselues / and defend their cause / when they do alledge that out of
the Actes of the Apostles:
<span class = "sidenote">
Actor. 21.</span>
where mencion is made howe that Paule / through the councell of the
Elders of the churche of Hierusalem / did take on hym a vowe with other
foure men / and did purifye hymself after the maner and custumme of the
Iues. Yf (saye they) suche an Apostle dyd take thys lybertye to vse in
Iurie the ceremonies which were now abrogated / euẽ we also maye vse /
and comme vnto the rites / and ceremonies now vsed in our countrithe.
For the better vnderstõding of this matter we must first well consider
what the somme of Paules preachinge was:
<span class = "sidenote">
Rom. 3.</span>
We do suppose (saith he) that a man is iustified by faith / without the
workes of the Lawe.
<span class = "sidenote">

And as many as are vnder the deedes of the Lawe

<span class = "sidenote">
Abac. 2.</span>
Agayne the Iuste man shall lyue by his faithe.
<span class = "sidenote">
Rom. 1.</span>
This is the somme of Paules doctrine / wherby it doth appeare / that
Paule did not vtterly condẽne the obseruing of the ceremonies of the Law
/ but only whẽ it was done with this minde / as thoughe that
Iustification did not cõme therby. And the same his meaning he vtterith
most playnly to the Galathians / where he saithe.
<span class = "sidenote">
Gal. 5.</span>
As many of ye as are circumcised / ye are fallen from the grace of

These thinges of theyr owne nature do not alienate and separate vs from
Christe / but only when they be done with this mynde and purpose / to be
Iustified by them: Take awaye this opinion / and this euell hurtefull
purpose being remoued / then Paule cõmendeth these worckes / and all
other ciuyle ordinaunces cõmaunded / and appoynted to that Nacion: he
condẽneth them not / but so farre as they wer iustly and not

ãd did not hinder the obseruacion of them. As he dyd also write / that

Paule doth speake / when of him self he saieth: I&nbsp;am made all vnto
all mẽ / that I might wynne manye: Vnto the Iues / I&nbsp;am made as a
Iue / to thẽ which are without the lawe / as though I were without a

<span class = "sidenote">
Actor. 16.</span>
For when he was required to circũcise Timothie / because that the
custumme which was yet in force might be kept / he did it: But when they

shulde likewise circumcise Titus /
<span class = "sidenote">

In no wyse wolde he gyue place vnto them / no not for the space of one

or to betray our libertie. S.&nbsp;Paule did obserue these thinges then
/ when it might be done without an euell mynd / when no hurte shuld
ensue of it: The cause ãd end why Paule did it / was to auoide the
offendinge of the beleauing Iues / les yf he did it not / they shuld
therby be alienated and turned awaye from Christes gospell / which they
had newly receyued. But we must not compare these ceremonies of the old
lawe with the Inuencions of men / they can not be iustly compared with
Massing: They were plainly taught in Goddes worde / but these masses and
popishe Idolatries are thrust vnto vs by the subtiltie of the deuell /

indifferẽt / and as such thinges might be well vsed. But these are
thinges vtterly euell and can not be well vsed. They after Christes
ascenscion into heauẽ wer not forbidden / and therfor might be obserued
/ so long as the Temple and common welth of Israel did cõtinue and the

<span class = "sidenote">

Neyther wer those ceremonies / as Augustine saith / suddenly and without

supersticions / which are farsed full with Idolatrie / alwayes haue
beene / are / and shalbe forbiddẽ. Those thinges might therfor be keapt
and obserued for a tyme / so that men did not vse them with that mynde

matier it self / that is / the nature of the acte / Paule can neither be
therin reprehended / nor yet can these dissemblige Massehaunters vse his
well doinge as a defence for their euell doinge: but much les can this
be done / yf thou wilt searche out the mynde / councell / and entent of
Paules doinge. Bothe these thinges these mayntayners of massehaunting do
want. For furst they are occupied in a thing which is contrary / and
repugnant to Godds worde / as it is already declared. Secondly / in thys
their dissimulacion they do only seke themselues / for to thend that
they maye retayne their riches / dignitie
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>

/ and estimacion by falling to poperye they offend the weake and drawe
them by their example from Christe to Antichrist / wheras Paule did
herin obserue thinges commaunded in Goddes worde / and thẽ to this ende
only / les the beleauing Iues shuld fall backe frõ Christ / and that he
might the more easily drawe others / which yet beleaued not / to the
gospell of Christe. Furthermore these men do saye / that they by their
dissimulacion will auoide offence. For (saye they) yf we shuld so
vtterly forsake the Masse as ye wolde haue vs / we shulde be taken as
wicked mẽ ãd euell doers / ãd so shall we geue great offence in out
countrithes. I&nbsp;graũte that these men do seke to auoyd offence / but
what offence? euẽ the offẽce of the world. They will not offend / but
whom? Tyraũtes / ãd such as ar the very limmes of antichrist. And why?
les they shuld procure against thẽselues theyr wrath / poure / and
tyrãnie. But this is that offence / which Criste sayeth shuld not be
auoided:
<span class = "sidenote">

Let them alone (saith he of the Phariseis) They are blinde ãd the

hinder mẽ / be they simple / or wicked / that they do not embrace pure
doctryne / and turne vnto Christe. Now beholde / I&nbsp;pray the / by
cõming to the Masse / what offence thou doest gyue? The Idolatrous ãd
supersticious people / ar they not offended by this thy doing? Yeas
verely. For when they do se

the haũte their masses / they say / these gospellers do cõme to our
masses / which they wold not do yf our masses wer so euell as thei call
thẽ: wherfor we may perseuere ãd cõtinue in our old purpose. And on the
other parte / the weaker brethrẽ / which are but newly turned / ãd not
farr entered into the knowledge of Christ / whẽ they do se these better
lerned professors / enseyng bearers / and chief men in the scole of
Christ comme to the masse / they are taught to do the lyke: and wher
before they wer perswaded not to comme at masses / now they thincke that
they were then deceyued / and that it is but a fonde precise
scrupulositie so to abstayn from masses: and it cometh to pas / that
where they shuld go forwarde in the waye of truth / now they do go
backe. Thus both the wicked and the godly / are offended by thy example:
It is playne therfor that vnder the cloked colour of auoyding of offence
/ these men do fall into the very offẽce gyuing. They say morouer: It is
nedefull to cõdiscende vnto the weake: for there are many which are not
persuaded that the masse is naught / and therfor are neyther ready to
forsake their countrie / nor to dye in the quarell / whiche men yf they
shulde perceyue that we did not come to masse / they wold not gyue then
any ear or credite vnto vs in the other matiers and chief pointes of
religion: wherfore we must gyue and yealde somwhat vnto their infirmitie
/ as Paule doth teache the Romayns. This they saye.
<span class = "sidenote">

But what will Paule / I&nbsp;praye you / that we shuld yealde to the

in thinges indifferẽt. But those thinges which of them selues ar euell
and forbidden of Godd / must not be done in respect of any man.
<span class = "sidenote">
Rom. 3.</span>
For that same Rule doth stonde certayn which gyueth leaue to no mã to do
euell that goode maye comme theron. To abstayn / or not to abstayn from
meates / was then a thing indifferẽt. In such thinges they which be
stronger must beare with the Infirmitie of the weaker: but meate eating
ãd Massehauntinge are not lyke / for this is no thing indifferẽt / but
manifestly euell / as it is sufficiently proued / and therfor it is not
to be done in respect of bearing with any man that is weake. But are the
weake alwayes to be borne with all in thinges indifferent? no truly / we
must not alwayes yealde to the weake but only whylest they be taughte:
And when they do vnderstonde the thing that is taught them / and yet do
wauer and doubt of a wilful scrupulositie / their infirmitie is no

them / that out libertie shal be in subiectiõ to their frowardnes / nor
that therby we do hurte others by our example.</p>

The same thing maye be permitted to thẽ (they thincke) and that yt is as

August. Epist. 29. ad Hiero.</span>
That doth Augustine truly and playnly denye: He saith that the Stoickes
do go about to proue it / when they saye / that all vertues are cõioyned
and knitt together / so that he which hathe one of them hath all / and
he that wãtith one wãtith all. For wisdome (saye they) is not fearefull
/ nott intemperate / nut vniuste / therfor it hath ioyned with it the
vertues which be contrarie vnto these vices: And likewise iustice /
strẽghthe / tẽperaunce and other vertues are not vnwise / but are ioyned
with wisdome / wheruppon they do conclude / that all vertues are
conioyned and knitt together. Theise thinges / saith Augustine /

That in many thinges we do all offend / and If we saye that we haue no
synne / we do deceyue our selues and ther is no truithe in vs. Wherfor
seing that we synne in many thinges / and in synnynge we cã not haue
that vertue which is cõtrarie to that synne which we do committ / and
yet it may be that he which fallith in one synne / many be cõstaunt in
other vertues / the opinion of theis philosophers is fals. As for
example: Be it / that one be of an hastye nature / or do exceade measure
in eatinge / and yet he gyuith euery man his own / and will gyue his
life in Godds cause: though this man be fearce / and intemperate / yet
is he called a iust mã / and a stronge man. S.&nbsp;Augustine doth also
putt awaye the similitude of the stoicks / whiche is. That the man
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 078 -->
doth die in the waters / if they be but half a handfull ouer, his heade
/ aswell as he ouer whos heade they are / ten / or twentie cubites. This
is no apte similitude / saith he / therfor let vs take an other more
fitte for our purpose / of light namely and darcknes. Certaynly when one
is in darcknes / the more he dothe departe and go out of it and drawith
nighe vnto light / he begynnith the better to see sumwhat / and so
though that yet he be compassed with darcknes / yet is he sumwhat
partaker of the lighte. But he that wull knowe more of this matier / let
hym reade that Epistle of Augustyne: Wher he prouith playnly / that all
synnes ar not like / as the Stoicks did thincke: Now to return to our
place / which we did rehearce. He that offendith in one / is giltie of
all. Ther is no obseruacion of Godds Lawe to be receued with an
exception / as thoughe we might chose one parte of it to obserue / and
separate or sett asyde the other parte at our will and pleasure to
neglecte it. The commaundemẽtes of the lawe ar conioyned of the lorde
and knitt together / and so gyuen vnto vs: We must not now disseuer /
and separate thẽ as we lust / but without exception we must obserue the
whole lawe. We must consider and loke vppon the Auctoritie of the lawe
gyuer / which is Godd / It is of force aswel in one cõmaundement / as in
the rest. This doth Iames seame to meane / when he saith:
<span class = "sidenote">

of theise commaundemẽtes / then in an other. And therfor (to adde this
by the waye) let them wel consider what they do which do profes to
receyue the gospell / and yet they do refuse ecclesiasticall disciplyne:
Wheras the lorde / which hath reuealede and opened the gospell vnto vs
by Christe / doth appoint discipline to be a parte therof. Theise men do
synne against the whole lawe. The papistes do also synne herin / which
do preache their parted righteousnes / as meritorius of congruitie. But
to returne / this is also manifest / that he that synnith in one / is
therfore giltie in all / for that as now by lust and tentacion / he is
caried into sum one transgression / and so dothe synne / euen in like
manier shuld he offend in an other euill / if he wer assaulted in the
same sorte / and whith that same violence of tentacion. And Augustine in
the place before alledged. doth saye. That therfore he is made giltie of
all / bicause he synneth against charitie / vppon which the obseruacion
of the whole lawe is grownded. To be short therfor / when we do thus
fall into synne / we must not lightly tryfle it of and excuse it /
sayinge that it is but light / and small: for synne is not to be
considered of the matier / and manier of the action only / but of the
force poure / and dignitie of Godds worde which doth forbidd it. And yet
les I shuld seeme to be to rigorus and strayte in this matier of
massehauntinge / let ther be hadd a consideracion / or difference of the
matier / and doinge.<br>
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>

And truly I can not see / how this kinde of synne and doinge cã be
iudged to be light / or small / seing that it is a transgressiõ
committed against the furst table of the lawe / in which the worship due
vntto Godd is cõmaũded which worshipp being sownde and safe in a mã

Whordõ by Godds lawe is to be punyshed by deathe / yet is it a synne but
against the .ii. table. And what shal we thincke then of spirituall
whordome? how seuerely doth Godd iudge it? how sharply ought it to be
punished? If therfor thow dost consider the commandement which thou
breakest / it is of God: If the matier / it is <ins class = "notation"

this / our men do counte this Masse hauntinge a fault to be either
contemned / or not so depely to be considered in theim bicause they do
not synne with mynde will and affection / but as it wer compelled and of
necessite. But I aske them / what manier a violence and compulsion this
is throughe which that necessite commithe of which they make their
excuse? Truly they can not saye that it is ony other / then bicause they
wolde not ronne into the daunger of the losse of their Goodes / their

This is then no absolute necessite but such a one as risith of ther own

losse which shippmen do suffer in a tempest / which do cast out of their
ship al their Goodes whẽ they be in daunger of shipp wracke: They seame
truly to be compelled to do it / and yet willingly they do it / and
therfor they are sayed .To do. bicause that withe deliberacion and
aduise / they do determin / both with iudgemẽt and will / rather to
abide the losse of their goddes / thẽ of their lyfe. Which thinge as the
mariners do wisely determyne / so our men do folishly / which for the
loue that they beare to their lyfe / bodie ãd goodes do not chose to

they cõmitt doble synne. Furst they synne willingly. Thẽ they do prefer
earthly thinges before heauẽly / outward thinges before inward / the
bodie before the soule / their Goodes before God: Which is not done but
of such / as ar the very childrẽ of the world. Of affectiõ verily /
though they do saye nay / they do that which they do / but of that
inordinate affection which they do beare to their riches. Wherfor this
is no iust excuse which they make. For as well might the Corinthians /
euen by the very same reason / haue sayde to Paule. If we do comme vnto
these feastes wher the meates offered vnto Idols are eaten / we do it
not with that mynde as thoughe we allowed such sacrifices / but we ar

I&nbsp;grant that ther are daungers / such is theyr Tyrannie. But
remember thou / That Godd hath forseene all theise daungers before / and
also hath shewed that they shuld comme / of which though he wer not

and dwellinge togither of the vnfaithfull with the faith full:
<span class = "sidenote">
The answer</span>
I&nbsp;thinke that it is lawfull / but yet so that they muste take hede
of certeyn thinges / and obserue ans kepe certeyn Rules and
conditions.</p>

<p>The firste is / that they do not enforce nor compell their faithfull
subiectes to ioyne with the vnbeleauers in their assẽbles / nor in such
vnholy kyndes of worshipp of Godd as are cõtrary to Godds worde: for
then shold they not be Godds ministers / as they are taughte to be in

furie. Then sholde they be a feare vnto them that do well / and not to
them that do euill / neither sholde they promote the worke of God / but
the tyranye of Antichriste.</p>

<p>The secõde is / they muste not graunte nor suffer / the vnfaithfull
to vse their supersticions and wicked Idolatries which are cõtrarie vnto
Godds worde. For it is not sufficient / that they do not compell the
godly to wicked supersticiõ and Idolatrie / but also they muste forbidde
the same to the wicked Idolatrours: For not doinge of this Salomõ is
greatlie accused:

Indeed he did not compelle the Iues to worshipp Idolles / but yet did he

him / that as he suffered his true worshippe to be parted ãd diuided /

it came vnto his sõne / ãd parte to Ieroboã the sõne of Nabat. And agayn
for doing of this / Achaz / ãd other wicked kĩges wer reproued of the
prophetes. Magistrates are apoĩted to be the defẽders / ãd executours of
the first table of the lawe as well as of the secõde: with what
obseruatiõ thẽ of iustice cã a magistrate graũte or suffer Idolatrie to
be vsed? It is writõ that he hathe the sworde to punishe euill thĩges
and vices. If it be his part to punishe theues / ãd not to permitt them
/ the same must he do to Idolatrours. Or ells we must saie that
Idolatrie is no such synne ãd vice as theft is / or that with other
vices it is not to be punished. And that theis prĩces maye do this the
better / they muste thẽ selues take hede that they be cleare frõ these
Idolatries ãd supersticiõs. Augustine writĩg againste the donatistes

which do agree with the worde of God / ãd forbid those which are
cõtrarie to yt. I&nbsp;do not saie that they must be to curius in
ceremonies / as many are / which wolde that ĩ any wise all rites ãd
ceremonies sholde be throughli ãd in all places of oone sorte / ãd
manier: But this theis princes shold prouide / that the ceremonies vsed
in ther churches sholde not be contrarie to godds worde / yea and that
they sholde most neerely agre therwith / ãd shuld make for godly
edyfyinge and decẽt and comelye ordre in the churche: But of their
liknes / ãd that ĩ all places the rites / ãd ceremonies shold be of one
forme / I&nbsp;do not thinke it a thing worthie the labor. For what
matter maketh it if some men do receyue the sacramẽt stõding / other
sittinge / other kneling. And if in some places whilest the bretherẽ do
cõmunicat / a&nbsp;place of the scripture be redd / or some psalmes be

are to be lefte so free that in the churches suche maie be vsed / as
shall seme most meete for the edyfyinge of the people. Yea I suppose
that this varietye and chaunge in rytes / and ceremonies / dothe not a
lytell profyte ãd helpe to bring in a true opiniõ of ceremonies / and to
haue it kepte also: that is / that mẽ shuld beleue that all those
ceremonies which the holie scripure doth not apoint / are not necessarie

<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 088 -->
Godd which haue in their hand the orderinge the churche. That moste
worthie commen wealthe of the venetians / which haue vnder their
dominions / many Cities and places in Grece / they do in eche of them
permit and suffer the rytes / and ceremonies / bothe of the Greke
churche / and of the Latin churche / for those wise men do thincke /
that the dyuersytie in outward ceremonies which are not taught in Godds
worde is not hurtefull. I&nbsp;do not alledg this to allowe all such
ceremonies as they do permitt in thos places / but only to shew that
they thincke it not a matter of necessite to haue all one forme of
ceremonies: The verie same thinge before thẽ did Augustine iudge as in
his epistles to Ianuarius / and Cassulanus it dothe apeare.</p>

<p>The thirde thinge is / that the princes and rulers which do suffer
these vnfaithfull mẽ to dwell ĩ their dominions sholde prouide that they
mighte be taughte the truithe: and in this behalfe they muste not
neglect them: for as the princes do declare their gẽtilnes in suffering
thẽ to dwell in their dominions so this their pacience muste be directed
to the glorie of God: And howe can that be soughte in theis vnbeleauers
/ if they be suffered to abyde in their noughtie opinion without
teachinge: Surely by thys meanes in processe of tyme they be made no
whit the better / but a greate deale worse then they were before.</p>

<p>The fourth is / that these princes take Godd hede / that by this
dwellinge and cõuersation which they
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<span class = "folionum">fv</span>
<!-- png 089 -->
do graunte vnto the vnfaithfull / they do not infecte the poeple
cõmitted to their cure and chardge with their scabbe of vnbelefe ãd
errour. Charytie is to be shewed vnto straungiers indede / but yet not
so that they muste hurte the poeple amõg whom they lyue. And this shal
the princes remedie very wel / if that they do not always beare with the
corrupt blindnes of the <a class = "error" name = "error45" id =
"error45" href = "#corr45">vnbeleauers</a> / but after sufficient
teachinge do compell them to embrace true religion. I&nbsp;say that when
they haue prouided that these vnfaithfull haue bene taught a good whyle
and truly instructed / they must then enforce and compell them vnto
those holye and pure rytes and worshippinges of Godd which are
commaunded in the scriptures: for princes and rulers must not alwayes /
nor yet to longe suffer theyr cytyzens and subiectes / to lyue without
exercise of godlynes and vertue. The ende of policall gouernemente is /
that the subiecte both sholde lyue in felycytie / ãd also in the
practyse of godlynes / because that godlines and the true worshipp of
God is the chefest of all vertues.</p>

<p>But some man will obiecte against me / and say / yf so be that the
vnfaithfull be not yet persuaded / they shall then embrace truthe
against theyr conscience / which thinge yf the prince compell them to do
/ then he compelleth them to synne. Here must we make a difference
betwene the thinge that of it selfe is synne / and that which is so by
chaunce / by some fortune / or some other thinge that happeneth / per
accidens, as the Logicians do saye: for whẽ the
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 090 -->
Magistrate / in the matter which now we haue in hãd / dothe propounde
vnto these his subiectes / the thing that is right / goode / iuste / and
cõmaunded of God / prouidinge to haue them taughte therin / and they
will not be taughte / yf then he enforceth them owtwardlye to vse none
other order in religion then is commaunded of Godd / and to forsake all
other / he doth that which is iuste and appertayninge to his office. But
that synne is entermingled in this matter / truly it is not throughe the
faulte of the prince / but it is of the vnbeleif of these men / of
whiche the prince can not be iustly accused / when he hath diligẽtly
done his part / that they shold be well instructed. Morouer them which
do obiecte this consider / that by the same reason that they accuse
these princes we may accuse God: for he doth propounde his lawe / which
is moste perfyte to be obserued of all men. Shuld men saye? we are weake
/ our nature is corrupte and infected / neither can we do these thinges
as thou dost commaunde them / And why dost thou then enforce this lawe
vpon vs? If we do cõtrarie to that which thou doest commaunde / verely
we synne / and yf we go not about to do it we synne / we shall synne
also yf we go aboute to do that which thou commaundest / for we want of
perfection / neyther do we obey as we sholde do: wherfore do what we
will / we shall not auoyde synne: vnto this the Lorde wolde aunswer. The
thinges that I do propounde to be obserued of you are iuste and perfect
/ no man can accuse them of wickednes / But in that
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<!-- png 091 -->
ye are weake and do fall / and faile in fulfilling of my lawe / the
faulte muste not be layed vnto me / for it is of your own malice and
corruptiõ / and not through my faulte / for the which I maye not
withdrawe my holy commaũdements / Yet thus I haue prouided helpe for you
/ Beleue in my only dearly beloued sonne / and loke what so euer ye
wante / wherin soeuer ye do fayle / and not fulfyll my commaundementes /
it shall not be imputed / nor laid to your chardge vnto euerlasyinge
deathe: yea your endeuoyrs and your doinges / although they be not fully
perfect ãd absolute / yet will I accepte thẽ well / they shall please me
/ and I will allowe thẽ. Euen so shall the good prince and Magistrate
saye: The thinges which are conteyned in Goddes worde / suche thinges as
are comlye and do edifie / do I require of you / yf your mynde and
conscience do go agaynst them / ye can not impute it vnto me /
I&nbsp;haue laboured and done my parte that ye sholde not be ignoraunt /
and miserablie perish in ignoraũce. I&nbsp;haue caused you to be
sufficiently instructed / and nowe will I procede exhorting /
admonishinge / and demaundinge of you obedience in these thinges: do you
reade the holye scriptures / heare the teachers and pastours / ãd pray
the Lorde to open the eyes of your harte and mynde. Thus in aunswering
to this obiectiõ I shew what a goode prince in this case may and must
do. That thinge also is not to be passed ouer of which Augustyne maketh
mencion / that he hymselfe was somtyme of this opinion / that nothing
sholde be violẽtlye
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 092 -->
done agaynst heretiques / but that they shold only be taughte / But his
mynde altered after that he was admonished by some wyse Bishoppes / howe
certeyn cities / which somtyme were altogether corrupted with the errour
of the Donatistes / were cõpelled by the violence of the lawes of good
Emperours to receyue the catholike faith / ãd these at lẽgth were so
syncerelie tourned vnto the truthe / that they dyd gyue to God moste
hartye thãckes for that violent enforcement / sayinge that nowe thoughe
they might safelye / yet by no meanes wolde they retorne any more to
suche pernicious and hurtfull opiniõs. The prince therfore / after that
he hath gyuen them sufficient instruction / yf he shall enforce these
men vnto the embracing of such rites and ceremonies as are good and
godlye indede / he shall do no hurte at all but muche good. I&nbsp;do
meane that this sholde be practysed only vpon suche as be cityzens / and
naturall borne subiectes / or suche as beinge straungers borne / do as
denizens dwell in theyr domininiõs / ãd so by priuiledge haue the
benefite of theyr coũtrithe: Otherwyse yf they be but straũgiers which
do passe through their countrithe / or such as do come either to bye or
to sell marchaundize / there is no suche violẽce to be shewed towardes
thẽ. And yet this thing they must take heade of euen in thẽ / that they
do not seduce their people ãd subiectes which are of a good iudgement /
that they do not infect them with vice and errour. The Israelites / as I
thincke / ar in this pointe to be folowed. They did admitt no straunger
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<!-- png 093 -->
to be as a Iue / or proselyte / neyther did they gyue vnto any the
libertie of their countrith / except he did fyrst circũcise himself /
admitt Moses lawe / did cõmunicate / and became partaker with them in
theyr Sacrifices / submitting himself to their discipline: Which thinge
/ seing it was well and diligently obserued of them / why shuld not our
princes do euen the same? That they shuld suffer no Citezen / nor
subiect / eyther naturall / or straũger born / but that they shuld
compell and enforce hym / to receyue such religion / and obserue such
rites and ceremonies / agreing with Godds worde / as they by common
autoritie haue establyshed. Now will I speake of those princes and
Rulers / which ar vnder these chief Rulers. Whome I do deuide into two
sortes. Eyther they are such as haue Iurisdiction / poure / and
auctoritie / which commeth to them by discent frõ theyr Auncetours / or
els committed vnto them of Emperours / Kinges / and common welthes:
Eyther els they haue no Iurisdiction nor Rule ouer others / neyther by
discent from theyr auncetours / nor by commission from other higher
princes / but only are taken and estemed as men of worshipp / for the
auncientnes of their house and blud / or for their riches. This last
sorte do not differ at all in a maner from priuate men / of whom I haue
spoken before / for these are mere subiectes as they are. Therfor
(I&nbsp;do suppose) that the former Rules / appointed vnto priuate men
and subiectes are to be committed vnto thẽ / to be obserued of thẽ / in
such maner as I haue
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 094 -->
before declared. But of this other sorte of Princes and Rulers / of
which some by right of inheritaũce / some by vertue of office committed
vnto them / are Rulars and gouernours of countrithes / cities and
places. Of these I do saye and pronoũce this / That in matters which do
belong to Godd and true Religion / they ought to do no other things /
but those / which I haue already shewed that the muste do / which are
meere / absolute / and the hygher princes and Rulars. For it is not
lawfull for them / no not at the commaundement of theyr hygher Princes
and Lordes / to compell those subiectes ouer whom they haue rule / to
recyue wicked Religion and supersticion / neyther to permitt the
vnfaithfull in the places where they do beare Rule / to haue theyr
vngodly Idolatries and supersticions. This must thei not do / no thoughe
they were (I&nbsp;saye) therunto cõmaunded by theyr hygher princes and
Lordes / of whom / and vnder whome / they haue theyr auctoritie. But yf
thou wilt saye / that they must obey theyr hygher poures / I&nbsp;will
graunt that / but (as the sayinge is) <em>vs<sup>que</sup> ad Aras</em>,
that is vntill they do come to matters of Religion / and vntill they do
commaunde in Religion thinges contrarie to Goddes worde and truthe. For
when they shall commaunde that which is against Godd / and is hurtefull
to the conscience of mã / these magistrates must not obey thẽ. For these
vnder Rulars are called into a parte of the cure and charge of the goode
gouernemente of the countrie / by the force of theyr dignitie and
office:<br>
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<!-- png 095 -->
They must not therfor putt those thinges in execution / whiche are
agaynst Godd / and are hurtefull to theur countrye: Yea they ought both
to persuade by reason / and to defende by poure the contrary.<br>
The Lacedemonians / when they whiche hadd ouercomme them / did demaunde
of them such thinges as were against the ciuile lawes and libertie of
their citie / They answered / If ye do commaunde vs to do thinges which
ar more weightie and greuous then death / we wyll rather dye then do
them: Thus ought these vnder Rulars answer theyr higher Lordes / when
they do commaunde them to do thinges which are to the defacing of Godds
glorie ãd truth / and to the wounding and vnquieting of the consciences
of the subiectes / whiche thinges are more weyghtie and greuous then
death indeede. In Cyuile thinges they may gyue place to the vniust
commaundementes and decrees of theyr hygher Lordes / but that ought they
not to do in the cause of Godd / and pure Religion. The Machabees at
such tyme as the Iues were vnder the rule of the Macedonians (Antiochus
/ Demetrius / and Alexander / I&nbsp;meane) which princes did leade the
people awaye from the true worship of God / and from the seruice taught
in hys worde / wolde not obeye them. But that house and tribe of the
prestes called <em>Asmonei</em>, whiche in dignitie were nexte vnto the
house and stocke of the Kinges / and bare the chief Rule nexte vnto it /
les that the true worshippe of Godd commaunded and taught in the lawe /
and which hadd bene retayned and vsed in theyr countrye / shulde
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>

be thus leafte and forsaken / they did Rebell against thos kinges as the
hostorie doth witnes. But if this historie for the insufficiencie of the
auctoritie of the bocke (which yet is a true historie / as Iosephus also
doth witnes) will not suffice to proue this matier: Then let vs consider
what Ioiada the bishopp did in the dayes of Athalia:

It is true indeede that the holy scriptures do commaunde / that euerye

is lawfull to obey / and no further. For the holy scriptures do likewyse
say / that the Rular is not any feare to them that doth good / but to
them that do euell. Wherfor seying these princes / in this case by theyr
endeuour and laboure / do promote that which is goode / they do well and
not euell: and so ought they for this doinge to be without fear of the
hygher poure / because that herin they do not resiste agaynst them /
with that Resistaunce which is forbidden. Wilt thou (saith he) be

<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 098 -->
feare of the poure? do well then / and so shalt thou be praysed of the
same: If these princes and rulars do defende godlynes and religion /
they do good / then by the iudgement of Goddes worde they are without
feare of the poure / and do deserue prayse of theyr hygher poures and
lords. But yf thou do euell (saith Paule) then feare the poure / for he
beareth not the sworde for nought / but is the minister of Godd to take
vengeaũce on them which do euell. Thus doth this place arme the myndes
and cõsciences of these inferior princes of whom I speake / that they
shulde note feare theyr hygher poures / when for the defence of Goddes
religion / they do resiste and not obeye theyr wicked commaundementes.
Yf any will now thus saye agaynst me. He that hath the kinglye and
supreame auctoritie / vnto whom by othe I do owe obedience / commaundeth
these thinges / and therfore I must obey. I&nbsp;answer that thou arte
not boũd herin to keape any such othe or promis. For when he commaundeth
those thinges whiche are agaynste God / he dothe not the office of
Goddes minister / to him thẽ therin thou dost owe neyther faith nor
obedience. Agayne yf thou wilt aske / By what righte may these vnder
rulars and inferiour magistrates / thus sett them selues agaynst the
hygher princes / which haue the verye supreame right and poure to
defende pure and godlye Religion / and the true faithe. I&nbsp;aunswere.
That the electours of the Empire / and the Princes of Germanie / and the

<span class = "pagenum">50</span>

in kingdoms / they do and darre do it / by the Kinglye poure and right
lykewyse committed vnto them. For Emperours and Kinges / and such hygher
poures / haue therfor chosen and taked these vnder Rulars and officers /
as it were into a parte of theyr Rule / to be theyr helpers / in
administringe and ordering theyr businesses and charge / to the ende
that Iustice might florishe so muche the more. And euen so from the
begynninge poure and Rule was gyuen vnto these / that they shulde rule
the common wealthe / for that part therof / whiche was committed vnto
them / iustlye / vprightlye / and godlye. Wherof the Emprour in the Code
doth saye / that yf he shulde commaunde anye thinge agaynste righte / he
wolde not that any suche decree of his shulde auayle in iudgementes. The
very same thinge is to be sayde / where a kinge or suche which do
retayne the supreame auctoritie / do commaunde or determyne anye thynge
againste right. Not vnworthy is Traianus the Emperour therfore commended
/ who when he delyuered the sworde to a Rular in his Empire / sayde: If
I do cõmaunde Iuste thinges / vse this for me / but yf I do require
vniust things / vse it against me. But on the contrary part / Gregorie

dispraysed / and accused: Who seinge that the lawe whiche Mauritius the

of the common wealth / or which was appointed to the warrs / might be

hadd seene hys lawe / he was wonderfullye afrayed and astonied / And
therfor he desireth hym to diminshe somwhat of the rigour of the lawe or
els to chaũge it altogether: But yet he added / That as touchinge
hymself / after that he hath now done his office in admonishing hym /
now for the obedience which he doth owe vnto him / he wolde publishe his
lawe / as he hadd commaunded. Thys acte surely can not / but be reproued
in this Busshopp. Agayn here thou wilt happily saye. What yf the hygher
Prince wil not allowe me to do myne office / or doth reuoke this parte
of myne office? Truly no man cã take that frõ thyne office / which God
hath cõmaunded the to do in it. No mã can discharge the of that dutye /
wherewith God chargeth the in thyne office / do thou the dutye that

straitly required / That Godds Religiõ is not to be promoted after this
manier by thẽ / but rather / that they do sufficientlye the thinge which
belõgeth vnto them / yf they do forsake theyr office / and gyue ouer

A&nbsp;confutation of the places alledged.</span>
Nowe this is remayning / that I sholde answer vnto those reasons which

the

faithfull with the vnfaithfull is lawfull / and confute them. Firste /
the example of Christ is set against vs / which dyd eate and drinke
familiarlye with scribes / pharisees / publicanes / and synners. We
muste remembre that Christe was not only stronge / but the chiefe heade
of all them shich be stronge. He coulde so profyte them which were euell
/ that theyr euill shuld not hurte him / and therfore might vse
familiaritie with the wicked. Euen so there is no cause to the contrarie
/ but that they whiche be learned and constante in the truthe / suche as
can profit the vnfaithfull by their cõuersation and familiar being with
them / and not be hurt by it them selues (as we haue admonished before)
may be conuersaunt with the vnbeleauers and wicked.</p>

<p>The seconde place is /
<span class = "sidenote">
1. Cor. 7.</span>
Paule wolde not that the faithfull maried vnto an vnbeleuer sholde
departe / yf the vnbeleuer will dwell together with the other. This I do
also acknowledge / as befor I haue said: for vnto thẽ / al necessary
businesses / especially those which are ordeyned of God / are to be
done. And yet in that place which is here alledged / Paule is not so to
be vnderstanded without exception / as these mẽ do iudge: for yf the
vnbeleuĩg maried parson / shold cõtinually moue the faithfull to
Idolatrie / or sholde not cease to blaspheme Christ / and prouoke the
other to cõmit like blasphemie / so lõg as thei did liue together / this
ioynt life in mariadge were not to be cõtinued: for this were not to
dwell together / but to conspire together against Christ: Paule therfor
speaketh
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 104 -->
of suche cohabitacion as is laufull without suche soliciting or mouinge
to euell and blasphemye.</p>

<p>An other sentence of Paule is broughte which he writeth to the
Corinthians /
<span class = "sidenote">
1. Cor. 5.</span>
where he teacheth that all couetous parsons / euill speakers /
dronckardes / whoremũgars / and such lyke are not to be auoided / for
then sholde they haue gone out of the worlde.<br>
But he wold / that we sholde kepe our selues frõ thẽ / which being
called brethren / are infected with these vices. As concerninge this
place / we must consider the mynde and purpose of Paule. Firste he dyd
perceyue that for the necessitie of lyfe it coulde not be that the
faithfull shulde auoyde the companie of all which at that tyme were
vnbeleuers / for the greater part of men at that ceason was without
Christ / and they beinge auoided of our men / coulde not therby haue
bene made the better / But into thẽ which before were bretheren / bothe
sorowe and shame was dryuen / when they dyd see that they wer now
shonned of the godlye / to whome as they were before righte deare / so
with them they were familiar. And by this meanes the church was not
euill reported / neither for clokinge of euill among themselues / nor
for to seuere separatinge themselues from them which were not yet
conuerted: seing that they lyued with the vnbeleuers / partly for the
necessitie of lyfe / partlye to turne them to the gospell of Christ:
wherfore this sentence doth make nothing at all agaynst those thinges
which we haue alreadye spoken.</p>

mighte be better taughte / and ernestly caled vnto repẽtance. So dothe
God admonishe before he destroieth. So Abraham was sent amonge the
Cananites. On this sorte to go amõge the wicked / and vnbeleuers is
lawfull and laudable. But if Lot went to Sodõ only because the
pleasaunte commodytie of the place pleased him / he dyd not wel. Neither

Of the Iues</span>
As concerninge the Iues / there be certayn reasons why they are to be
borne withall and suffered. Of which Augustine / amonge others / doth
make mencion in many places. Furste / they aboue all other sortes and
nations of men hadde the promise made vnto them. Neither are they all
yet vtterly to be despayred of / for the roote remaynethe into the which
they maye be ingrafted agayne / and nowe and thẽ some of them / thoughe

therfore the lorde saueth / and preseruith them vnto this daye. And that

into a farre countrie / so the gentyles dyd departe so farre frome God /
that they worshipped Idolls as by a publike order and custome cõmenlye
receyued: But the elder sonne / by whõ the people of the Iues is
signified / went not farre awaie / but was in the felde / not in his
fathers house verylie / which is the church / but in the fielde / for
the Iues are occupied / and cõuersaunte aboute the letter of the

scater thẽ abroade. &amp;c. The sonne of God praieth the father / that
the Iues mighte not be vtterlie slayne and destroyed but scatered abroad
throughe the worlde. Other countries and nacyõs / being subdued of the
Romaynes receyued their lawes and rytes / and so became Romains / but
the Iues although that they also were ouercomme of the Romaines / yet
were they neuer made Romaĩs / neither ĩ ordinaũces / lawes / nor

<p>Neither is this their dispersion amonge all the nacions of the worlde

which they were broken awaie. Ther is another cõmoditie besydes this
that commith of this their dispersiõ which is / that they do kepe our
bokes / the holy byble I do meane. These they do carye aboute with them
/ they reade them / and thoughe they beleue not / because they are
blinded / yet do they cõfesse that these wrytinges are true. And so
though they be our enemies in their mynde / yet the bokes which they
haue and do reuerẽce / are our witnesses. wherfore I cã not maruayle
ynoughe at those mẽ which do persequute and hate the tonge of the
Hebrewes / and the Hebrewe bibels / and do burne them / whẽ as Augustine
in his boke /
<em>De doctrina Christiana</em>, dothe bidde /
<span class = "sidenote">
Lib. 2. ca. 11.</span>
that we sholde go to the truithe of the Hebrue tonge / if we do doubte
in any place of our translations. The selfe same thinge dothe Hierome
teache in manye places. But they saie that these bokes are corrupted of
the Iues. Heare I thinke good
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<!-- png 109 -->
to answer with Hierome. Either saithe he they dyd this before the
comminge of Christe / and the preachinge of the Apostles / or after: if
before / it is maruell that when Christ / the Apostles / and Paule / dyd
reproue moste shãfull faultes in the Iues / that they wolde haue kepte
in silence so greate and haynous a sacriledge as this: surelie if it
hade bene so / they wolde haue reproued yt. But if it was done after
Christes ascẽsiõ / they wolde thẽ chieflie haue corrupted those places
which do make mẽciõ of Christ / and those which Christe / and his
Apostiles did alledge. But those remayne safe and vncorrupte / the same
sense and meaninge of thẽ is in their bible in which they were recyted
of Christe / and his Apostles (for aboute the wordes they were not so
curious) wherfore it is not lyke / that they haue corrupted any other
places at all in the holy bokes of the scripture. Yea if a mã dothe
iustly beholde thẽ / he shall see that they haue many moo testimonies
and sentences for vs / more plaine / I&nbsp;saye / then our cõmen
translatiõ hathe / as in the .2. Psal. kisse the sonne / where ours
hathe / laie holde of knowledg. In like maner the whole .53. of Esaie /
which dothe moste plainlie prophecie of Christ / remaynith vncorrupt.
The bokes therfore are not corrupted. Yea they coulde not haue corrupted
those bokes thoughe they wolde / but it shuld be easyly espied: for ther
be of them many moste awncient in wryten hande / which haue bene kepte
moste diligentlie of Christians. But let vs retourne to the profyt that
Augustine speaketh of. Many <a class = "error" name = "error55" id =

<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 110 -->
thinke / that those thinges which are spokẽ of the olde people were
vayne and fayned / and likwise those thinges which we do tell owte of
the prophettes / excepte they dyd see the Iues thẽselues yet liuinge /
and remayninge / with their bokes / which do beare witnesse to the
thinges that we do speake: wherfore though the Iues be blinded in mynde
/ and in harte are our enemyes / yet euen them and their bokes we haue
moste plaine witnesses of out faithe. Aske thẽ of the prophettes whom
Christ dothe alledge / they graunte them to be true. Aske them of the
vnderstandinge of thẽ / in yt they are ignoraunte / because they are
blinded. And amonge all other witnessinges / that witnesse which is
gyuen of a mãs enemie is of greatest weight / and makith most for him:
Of suche witnesses truly the lorde hathe prouided good stoore for his
churche. For we haue not only the bokes of the Hebrues to make for vs /
but also the verses or rydles of the Sibylles / which were of an heathẽ
poeple. It is not to be thought / that our elders fayned thos verses:
for Sibylles bokes were euen commune / in all mens hands / in the tyme
of Eusebius the bishoppe of Cesarea / of Lactantius / and of Augustine.
All which do vse / and alledg them. But if they hade alledged false and
counterfett verses / the heathen mẽ which then excelled in knowledge /
and were very many also in numbre / they wolde haue reproued theym as
vayn men and lyars. If then men wyll gyue this vnto the verses of the
Sibylles that they be vncorrupte / moche more is it to be giuen
<!-- png 111 -->
to the bokes of the Hebrues. Thus hath it pleased the lorde to defende
and arme his churche / yea euẽ with the testimonies of his aduersaires.
Wherfor let the Iues be suffred amonge the Christians / both for the
promis which they haue of the saluaciõ to comme to their stocke / and
also for the commodities which they do carie with them / such as I haue
rehearsed. And for this cause / they be not only by lawes suffered / but
also they haue their Synagoges graunted vnto them: As in the Nouellis
Constitutionibus of Iustinian / and in the Decrees / it doth appere: But
this is permitted vnder such condicion that they shuld not haue moo
Synagoges then they hadd before / nor greater: Yet maye they repaire
them that fall into decaye: This was graũted to them / bicause that in
their cõgregacions / ther is no impiete / nor wickednes committed: They
do but reade only the bookes of the holy scripture / and do publiquely
praye. In which thinge yet the Magistrates and Bushopps / do euell /
which do not diligẽtly serche / take heede / and prouide / that they do
nothinge els in their congregations indeede / then that I haue spoken
of: for they shuld by al meanes take heede / that in their publique and
cõmon prayers / exhortations and readinges they do not speake euell of
Christe our lorde and Godd. Which thynge seing they do not / both the
Magistrates and the Bushopps are in greate fault. Vnto Turcks this ought
not to be graunted / that they shuld gather them selues together in
congregations to do their
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
<!-- png 112 -->
Godd seruice / bicause that in the same they reade neither the old
Testament / nor the newe / but only their own blasphemus and filthie
Alcorane. Morouer the Iues shuld be forbidden the practise of their
exchaũges / and their vsuries. For not without mutch dishonesti and
shame / do they afflicte many poore Christians therwith. But Christian
Princes and Rulars do take tributes / and gret taxes for these gaynes of
vsurie and shamefull couetusnes of the Iues / so farr ar they from
forbidding them these wicked practises. Agayne Christian princes do not
prouide to haue the Iues which do dwell vnder their dominions taught in
Goddes truithe: which indeede is an euill negligẽce in them: for truly
they ought to compell the Iues to comme vnto the godly sermons of the
Christians / and that often tymes. Els if they be left in this point
neglected / they do waxe dayly wors and wors / and lytill yea no hope at
all is ther to be hadd of their conuercion. Theise princes are likewise
bownd to take heade that the Iues do not corrupt the Christiãs / which
ar vnder their Rule / that they do not seduce them and bringe them into
Iuishnes. Neither shuld the weaker sort of Christians haue ony
familiaritie with them / but only such Christians as be learned / and
constant in the truithe. And that for such causes / as I haue alledged
before. Last of all it is meete and conueniẽt / that they shuld be known
from the Christians by their araye / or som suche outwarde signe / les
ony man at vnwares shuld be conuersaunt with them /
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>

as though they wer Christians. And thus mutch of the Iues shall suffice.

<p>This worde Hæresis, is deriued of the Greke worde / <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘αιρεῖμ’ [aireim] for [hairein]">αιρεῖν</ins>, which signifieth to chose / to pick / or to

Vnto this euell they are brought / either bicause they do not know the

of synnes to thẽ which do beleaue in Christe / and the threateninge of

dyd speake vnto the Iuishe people in their naturall tongue. The greke
churche did receyue the doctryne of the gospel of the Apostles (whiche

the Hebrues in theyr congregacions haue vsed their naturall Hebrue
tongue / so haue the Grecians their greke tongue / and so at the

these heretiques (the papistes I meane) are delighted with a straũge

repeted.</p>

<p>Wherfore Christian princes / whilest they do suffer them in their
dominions / they owghte no otherwise to suffer them / then vpon suche
condicyons as are aboue rehersed. That is / that they do compell no man
to partake their wicked Idolatries. That they do not permitt them to
haue their rites and supersticious ceremonies. That they take hede /
that they do not corrupte others which do beleaue truly / and be of good

that for theis causes. Firste bycause the Iewes are not Citizens in our

awaie and caste owte / as oftẽ tymes they haue beene handeled. And not
without iuste cause / when their conuersation hathe beene hurtfull. But
these papistes are our citizẽs / therfore they must be otherwise
handeled / and seinge they do confesse Christe / they are to be enforced
to his pure and true religiõ. Again the Iues can not do so moche hurte
as these Iebuzites maie / for all men / for the moste parte / do shonne
and deteste the Iue / But these are subtile sorcerers / which vnder the
cloke of the name of Christ / and ciuile familiaritie / maye deceyue
many: furthermore there is a promise of the saluatiõ of the Iues / to be
shewed ĩ the latter age / The lyke peculiar promise of papistes ther is
not. And yet I do not speake this / as though I dyd condemne the
counsell of many good prĩces / which haue cast the Iues owt of their
countrye / for good iuste and laufull causes. Their acte I do allowe.
But to returne vnto theise heretiques the papistes / we are bounde to

them do returne to the truith / and will embrace the true Religion of
Christ / they are not to be rebaptized. For though a Christian ought not
to demaunde baptisme in the popishe churche / yet the baptisme which

to cõme vpõ them / whose singular gifte the vnitie of the true churche
is. This ceremonie trulye is laudable / but yet seinge it is not
appointed to this purpose in the holye scripture / it maie be omitted:
because we do se that the cheifest vse of it (as the apostles vsed it)
was in the institution of the ministers of the churche. Suche of them as
haue bene byshopps / and elders / maie be receyued into their degrees /
and offices / if they do returne vnto the truithe: but this must be done
/ so as shall seme moste profitable to the flocke / and churche of the

churche / And if by their ministerie / the truithe of the gospell and
the saluation of the people which was committed vnto them maye be
propmoted more then by the ministerie of other / and aptelie / and as
profitable. They maie be restored to their place / ãd degree. The order
of which matter is lefte vnto the iudgement of the churche of God. But
if they remayne obstinate in their euill / and do continue peruerters of

needes be allowed of the lorde / and thow (if so be thow dost come to it

<p>Ther were in the tyme of the Apostles certayn witty disputars which
reasoned that it was lawful for Christians to eate meates offered vnto
Idols. Meates offered to Idolls / were sacrifices vsed in the temples of
Idolls / to be offered vnto Idols. Therfor thos faithfull men did
contend / that it was lauful indifferently to communicate with the holy
seruice of the Christians / and also to sytte down in the Idols feaste.
They did add plausible expositiõs / that an Idoll was nothinge / bycause
Godd was

not represented by the Idoll / that ther is but one Godd / the same our
true and euerlastinge Godd: Wherof it folowed that the Idoll was
nothinge / that is to say a thinge of no valure or a very vanitie / that
it could hurt no bodie / and that the very meate offered vnto the Idoll
was a thinge of nothinge / that it did defile no man. But Paule with
many wordes doth confute that folery. 1.&nbsp;Cor. cap. 8. 9.
and&nbsp;10. In this tenth chapter amonge other thinges he gatherith of
the nature of the supper of the lord that a man maye not bothe be
partaker of the supper of the lorde and of the table of Idols / and
saith: Ye cã not drincke of the cup of the lorde / and of the cup of
deuils. Ye can not be partakers of the lordes table / and of the table
of deuiles. Either do we prouoke the lorde? Are we strõger then he? Also
the Apostles of Christe and elders of the churche of Hierusalem in that
same greate and notable coũcell of Hierusalem / which of all that euer
were was most holy and of most auctoritie / did playnly forbidd the
Gentils / which were conuerted to Christe / thos meates offered to
Idols. Yea and the lord Iesus hymself in the boke of the Reuelacion doth

The Conclusiõ and adhortation to fre confessiõ.</span>
All they which be godly do both see and perceyue that they which do
desire to lyue euerlastingly haue neade to make a simple cleare and
playne cõfession / they see that Christes name must be confessed / and
that no man must communicate with Antichriste / how great so euer
daungers do hange ouer them / and how gret so euer the aduaũtages be
which are offered vnto them. They see that they must treade down the
feare and desire of the fleshe. The most holy Apostle of Christe writith
of Moses.
<span class = "sidenote">
Heb. 11.</span>
By faith Moses when he was greate / refused to be called the sonne of
Pharaos daughter / and chose rather to suffer aduersitie with the people
of Godd / then to enioye the pleasures of synne for a ceason / and
esteamed the rebuke of Christ greater riches / thẽ the treasures of
Egypt. For he hadd respect vnto the rewarde. Whos example (most goodely
indeede) that we

neuer lett slypp out of our myndes thos most holy most true and
healthefull wordes of our lord Christe / which I see neade often tymes

Mat. 10.</span>
Euery one that shall knowledge me before men / hym wyll I knowledge also
before my father which is in heauen. But whosoeuer shall denie me before
men / hym will I also denie before my father which is in heauen.

Luc. 9.</span>
For who so is ashamed of me and my wordes / of hym shall the sonne of

of the scripture most large promises sett furthe to them which do fely
confes Christe / and deny Antichriste with a goode corage. Iohn in the

Notes on the Text</a></h4>

<p>The printed book used an unusual system of page numbering. The recto
(right) side of each leaf was numbered in sequence; in addition, the
first <i>five</i> pages of each sixteen-page signature were numbered as
Ai, Aii... Both are shown in the left margin. The verso pages are shown
in this e-text by lines&nbsp;||.</p>

<p>The spellings “poeple”, “lenghth”, “satisficed” are standard; “pix”
may be more recognizable as “pyx”. The text normally used “v” initially,
“u” later in the word. The sidenotes used “vv” where the body text
used&nbsp;“w”.</p>

<p>Some vowels were written with an overline&mdash;here shown as a
tilde&mdash;representing a following nasal (m or n). Although some
combinations were more popular than others, there were no absolute
rules; it seems to have been done primarily to make lines come out even.
The overline never occurs in a partial line, as at paragraph-end.</p>
